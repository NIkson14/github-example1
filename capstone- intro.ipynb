Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Indian restaurant in Toronto , Canada . Since there are lots of restaurants in toronto, we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Indian restaurants in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met. \n\nI am developing a hypothetical scenario in this project for a concept that does not have enough Indian Restaurants in the Toronto area. So this might be a perfect opportunity for a Canadian-based entrepreneur. Since Indian food is popular among the Asian community, this entrepreneur may think about opening up his business in areas where the Asian community resides. With the intention in mind, finding the location to open such a restaurant is one of the most important decisions for this entrepreneur and I'm designing this project to help him find the most suitable place.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. \nAdvantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## TARGET AUDIENCE\nThe entrepreneur who wants to find the location to open authentic Indian restaurant."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Buisness Problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The goal of this capstone project is to find the most appropriate place for the entrepreneur to open a new Indian Restaurant in Toronto , Canada.
